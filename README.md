## Go to https://movie-rater-demo.firebaseapp.com/ for a demo of this project.
Front end developed using React and deployed on firebase.
Back end developed using Python Django and deployed on heroku.

This is a result of my completing React and Django course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-django-full-stack/). 

A simple project where a user can create an account, create/update/delete movies and their reviews.
